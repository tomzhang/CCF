Key-Value Store API
===================

This page presents the API that a CCF application must use to read and mutate the replicated key-value store.

A CCF application should define one or multiple public or private :cpp:class:`kv::Map`. Then, each :cpp:class:`ccf::HandlerRegistry::Handler` should use the :cpp:class:`kv::Tx` transaction object to read and write to specific :cpp:class:`kv::Map`.
